# 🛒 Demand Forecasting for Retail Sales

## 📌 Project Overview  
Retail businesses rely heavily on accurate **demand forecasting** to optimize **inventory, supply chain, marketing campaigns, and revenue planning**.  
In this project, we build **machine learning and deep learning models** to forecast retail sales using historical data.  

We focus on:  
- Exploring and analyzing time-series sales data.  
- Applying different **forecasting models** (ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM).  
- Evaluating model performance using relevant metrics.  
- Providing **business insights** for decision-making.  
- (Optional) Deploying an **interactive dashboard** with Streamlit.

## 🔹 Project Scope  
- Work with a **realistic retail sales dataset** (e.g., Walmart or Rossmann).  
- Explore historical sales trends, seasonality, and patterns.  
- Create features like **lagged sales, moving averages, holidays, and promotions**.  
- Train **classical time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet), ML models (XGBoost), and DL models (LSTM)**.  
- Evaluate models using **RMSE, MAE, and MAPE**.  
- Optionally deploy with **Streamlit** for interactive visualization.

## 🔹 Real Problem Statement

**Problem:**  
> Retail companies need accurate sales forecasts to **avoid stockouts or overstocking**. Poor predictions lead to lost revenue, higher storage costs, and missed opportunities during high-demand periods.

**Your Task:**  
- Predict **future sales** (weekly or daily) for each store/product.  
- Capture **trends, seasonality, and promotions** in the forecast.  
- Provide insights that help **inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and revenue optimization**.

**Example Questions Your Model Answers:**  
- How many units of Product X will Store A sell next month?  
- Which weeks will have peak demand due to holidays?  
- Which stores need extra inventory to meet forecasted demand?  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends.  
- Create **features** like holidays, promotions, and lagged variables.  
- Train **statistical, ML, and DL models** for forecasting.  
- Compare models and pick the **best performer**.  
- Translate results into **business recommendations**.

## 📂 Dataset  
You can use one of these datasets:  
- [Walmart Sales Forecasting (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)  
- [Rossmann Store Sales (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)  

### Dataset Description (Walmart Example)  
- **Store** → Store ID  
- **Dept** → Department ID  
- **Date** → Week of sales  
- **Weekly_Sales** → Target variable (sales amount)  
- **IsHoliday** → Boolean indicator for holidays

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, xgboost, prophet, keras/tensorflow  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly  
- **Deployment** (optional): Streamlit / Power BI

## 📊 Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing & EDA  
- Handle missing values, outliers.  
- Aggregate data by **store, department, week**.  
- Visualize sales distribution, seasonality, trends.  
- Feature engineering:  
  - Lag features (sales of previous weeks)  
  - Moving averages  
  - Holiday effects  
  - Promotions  

### 2. Model Building  
We experiment with different approaches:  
- **ARIMA / SARIMA** → for classical time-series.  
- **Facebook Prophet** → quick and interpretable forecasting.  
- **XGBoost / Random Forest** → machine learning regression approach.  
- **LSTM / GRU** → deep learning for sequential patterns.  

### 3. Model Evaluation  
Metrics:  
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)  

### 4. Business Insights  
- Seasonal demand spikes (festivals, promotions).  
- Store-level sales performance.  
- Forecasted sales for next **3–6 months**.  
- Actionable insights: inventory planning, marketing campaigns.  

### 5. Deployment (Optional)  
- Build a **Streamlit app** where users can:  
  - Select a store/product.  
  - View past sales trends.  
  - See forecasted demand for upcoming weeks/months.

## 📈 Results (Example Snapshot)  
- Best model: **XGBoost with engineered features**.  
- RMSE: *XYZ*  
- MAE: *XYZ*  
- Forecasts aligned well with **seasonal promotions & holidays**.  

---

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Add **multivariate forecasting** (temperature, CPI, unemployment data).  
- Try **transformer-based time-series models**.  
- Improve **real-time deployment** with APIs.  

---

## 📑 Key Takeaways  
✔ Demonstrates **EDA + feature engineering**.  
✔ Applies **statistical, ML, and DL forecasting models**.  
✔ Translates technical results into **business impact**.  
✔ Optional deployment makes it **portfolio-ready**.
