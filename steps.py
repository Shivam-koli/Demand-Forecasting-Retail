Day 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing

Load dataset (Walmart/Rossmann).

Handle missing values and outliers.

Aggregate sales by store, department, and week/day.

Visualize trends, seasonality, and patterns.

Day 2: Feature Engineering

Create lag features (previous week sales).

Moving averages, rolling statistics.

Encode holidays, promotions, or special events.

Split data into train/test sets.

Day 3-4: Model Building

ARIMA/SARIMA → classical time-series baseline.

Prophet → interpret trends and seasonality.

XGBoost / Random Forest → ML-based regression.

Optional: LSTM if time allows (advanced).

Day 5: Model Evaluation

Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, MAPE.

Compare models and pick the best performer.

Plot predicted vs actual sales for visual insights.

Day 6: Business Insights & Visualization

Identify seasonal spikes, store-level performance, and promotions.

Summarize actionable insights (inventory, marketing).

Create visualizations for key trends.

Day 7: README, Optional Streamlit Dashboard, Final Push

Update README with workflow, results, and insights.
